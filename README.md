# WorldPaintings
This project explores a dataset of global paintings and museum collections using SQL to uncover insights related to art styles, subject matter, and international artist presence.

**overview**
The goal of this project was to practice SQL querying and data analysis by answering real-world questions about how paintings are distributed across museums worldwide. The analysis focuses on Cubism, artist visibility across countries, and subject patterns within painting styles.

**Key Takeaways**

--Museums with a strong representation of Cubism also tend to showcase a diverse range of other modern art styles.

--A small number of artists are featured across a large number of countries, highlighting global recognition.

--Subjects like portraits and landscapes are consistently more common within specific styles, suggesting a strong link between artistic movement and subject matter.

--These patterns can support curators and cultural institutions in understanding and shaping exhibitions.

--Future analysis could explore temporal trends in painting styles over time.
