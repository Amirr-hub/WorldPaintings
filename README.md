# 🎨 World Paintings: A SQL Exploration

This project analyzes a global dataset of paintings and museum collections using SQL to uncover insights related to art styles, subject matter, and international artist presence.

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this project was to strengthen SQL querying and data analysis skills by answering real-world questions about how artworks are distributed across museums worldwide. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in Cubism representation, artist visibility across countries, and recurring subjects within various painting styles.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Museums with a strong representation of Cubism also tend to showcase a diverse range of other modern art styles.
- A small number of artists are featured in museums across many countries, indicating global recognition and appeal.
- Subjects like portraits and landscapes are consistently more common within specific styles, suggesting a strong link between subject matter and artistic movement.
- These patterns offer valuable insights for curators and cultural institutions looking to shape or analyze exhibitions.
- Future analysis could explore temporal trends to understand how painting styles evolve over time.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Google Docs (for presenting answers and insights)
